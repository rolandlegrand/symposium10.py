the script lets AI-agents ask the human a discussion topic, they discuss among themselves and then ask the human for feedback. The human can abort the process by 'exit'. In order to run this script successfully, pip install autogen openai langchain langchain_openai. Also tried to implement SQLite for a prototype LT memory but still problems.
